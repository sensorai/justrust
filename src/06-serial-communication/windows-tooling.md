# Windows tooling

Start by unplugging your micro:bit.

Before plugging the micro:bit, run the following command on the terminal:

``` console
$ mode
```

It will print a list of devices that are connected to your computer. The ones that start with `COM` in
their names are serial devices. This is the kind of device we'll be working with. Take note of all
the `COM` *ports* `mode` outputs *before* plugging the serial module.

Now, plug the micro:bit and run the `mode` command again. If you see a new
`COM` port appear on the list then you have that's the COM port assigned to the
serial functionality on the micro:bit.

Now launch `putty`. A GUI will pop out.

On the starter screen, which should have the "Session" category open, pick "Serial" as the
"Connection type". On the "Serial line" field enter the `COM` device you got on the previous step,
for example `COM3`.

Next, pick the "Connection/Serial" category from the menu on the left. On this new view, make sure
that the serial port is configured as follows:

- "Speed (baud)": 115200
- "Data bits": 8
- "Stop bits": 1
- "Parity": None
- "Flow control": None

Finally, click the Open button. A console will show up now:

If you type on this console, the yellow LED on top of the micro:bit will blink. Each keystroke
should make the LED blink once. Note that the console won't echo back what you type so the screen
will remain blank.
