# Just Rust

Rust is a language that is quite new, but already very popular. It's popular because it gives you the speed and control of C or C++ but also the memory safety of other newer languages like Python. It does this with some new ideas that are sometimes different from other languages. That means that there are some new things to learn, and  you can't just "figure it out as you go along". Rust is a language that you have to think about for a while to understand. But it still looks pretty familiar if you know another language and it is made to help you write good code.

# Who am I?

I wrote Just Rust while thinking of how to make it easy for companies here to start using it.
